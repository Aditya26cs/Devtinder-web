🔑 Core Concepts (Redux & Redux Toolkit)

1. State 🗃️
State = your app’s data at a given time.
Example: In a shopping app → cart items, user login info, theme mode, etc.
It’s like a database in memory for your React app.

2. Action 📩
Action = an object that tells what happened.
Example: { type: "cart/addItem", payload: { id: 1, name: "Shoes" } }
Has two parts:
type: unique string (like label)
payload: extra data needed to make the change
Think: Action = “a message/letter” you send to Redux to update state.

3. Reducer ⚙️
Reducer = a function that decides how the state should change when it receives an action.
It takes → old state + action → returns new state.
Example:

function cartReducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === "cart/addItem") {
    return [...state, action.payload]; // add new item
  }
  return state; // unchanged
}

Think: Reducer = rules book (if action = X, update state like Y).

4. Payload 🎁
Payload = extra info sent with the action.
Example: If the action is addItem, the payload might be { id: 1, name: "Shoes" }.
Without payload → Redux wouldn’t know which item to add.

5. Slice 🍰 (Redux Toolkit feature)
In Redux Toolkit, we organize state into slices (like cutting a cake).
Each slice = one feature/module of your app (cart slice, user slice, theme slice).

A slice contains:
The state (data)
The reducers (functions to change it)
The actions (auto-generated for you!)

Example (a cart slice):

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: "cart", // unique name for slice
  initialState: [], // cart starts empty
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.push(action.payload); // add item to cart
    },
    removeItem: (state, action) => {
      return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    }
  }
});

export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions; // actions auto-created
export default cartSlice.reducer;
